        <i>Note (1) :  'Market Share' represents market share for your analyst for that sector only. Please note that our analyst's vote is not necessarily equally weighted across the different sectors covered by them. Thus for example, if Cement and FMCG are covered by the same analyst, she may choose to assign her votes in a 30:70 ratio, indicating her priorities for that vote-period. Other votes are given by Fund Managers. The last column indicates the number of analysts voted for on the sell-side in a sector. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>Note (2) : Attached Tabular Information represents votes polled of Equity Funds & Equity Research, however Final Votes, Rankings & Brokerage are determined by the above as well as votes given by the Dealing Team.</i>
